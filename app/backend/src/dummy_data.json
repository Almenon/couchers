I've been a teacher, researcher, comedy writer, violin performer and a great cook for dinners with my friends.\n\nI like keeping very busy when I travel. If you've got any ideas for things to do, please drag me along! I love meeting energetic and funny people and organising small trips to go on with anyone I can wrangle together. Examples include hiking around wineries in Georgia, sailing along the Nile for a few days and exploring caves in Mexico.\n\nSharing food is a must! You can try so many more things that way.",
