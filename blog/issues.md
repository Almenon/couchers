# What CouchSurfing got wrong

If you look through the forum posts discussing CouchSurfing or chat to long-time users, you'll come across a conventional wisdom that CouchSurfing used to be amazing back in the "heyday"; usually pegged from the mid 2000s to the early 2010s. Hosts and surfers enjoyed [rich, active communities](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/new-couchsurfing/), a phenomenon replicated across the world and maintained by a volunteer workforce. In 2011, CouchSurfing filed as a [for-profit company](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201206/issie-lapowsky/couchsurfing-new-profit-model.html), a decision frequently cited as the start of the [decline of the community](https://www.nithincoca.com/2014/04/06/profit-couchsurfing-failed/). The number of users continued to grow, enjoying a boom from around [2.5 million users](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jan/22/budget-travel-stay-with-locals) at the time, to at least [12 million users](https://www.chicagotribune.com/real-estate/ct-re-chicago-couchsurfing-hosts-20180909-story.html) currently. However, the reality is that the community activity has seen a downturn and the platform has been overrun by creeps and travellers looking to score free accomodation, rather than looking for the genuine, non-transactional human experience that the forerunners sought to foster.

What was lost along the way was the influence, strength and moderation of communities. This was thrown away to be replace dby an attempt to monetize people's generosity. This created a number of inter-related problems within the platform, percolating into the community and into the whole couch-surfing experience.

## Profit and Incentives

A few weeks ago the CouchSurfing management decided to [force all users to pay for the service](https://medium.com/@jameshopest/the-death-of-couchsurfing-a87d9537edf2) and barring everyone from their accounts until they pay up.

CouchSurfing never should have been made a for-profit. While the founders may have seen no other choice, the point stands. There is certainly a moral dimension to driving profit from the hospitality of  others', evident in the clear outrage of experienced hosts at the recent change. However, if we investigate the effect of this profit motive on the mix of incentives on the platform, we begin to see a more systematic cause for the slip and downfall of CouchSurfing as a service.

As much as the people working on the platform want to optimise for a great experience for as many people as possible, they are beholden to their VC investors. The platform needs to optimise for profit, or at the very least is constrained by profit. This fact factors into every decision made by CouchSurfing since it was structured a an explicit for-profit company, and is confirmed by people [working inside the organisation](https://hackernoon.com/should-couchsurfing-be-a-dao-6507646e34ef).

As much as Silicon Valley would like to reject it, there are many ideas out there where profit would run against the incentives of making that idea successful. The practice of couch-surfing is one of those ideas: you cannot successfully monetize its userbase while meeting the needs of its community.

This is because CouchSurfing does not produce or facilitate any exchanges that could be monetized: at its core, it is a service for making real-world connections and messaging people. Because couch-surfing is a non-transactional practice, the company cannot skim off a percentage of the monetary exchanges between its users in a way similar to Etsy or eBay. Similarly, CouchSurfing has committed to [not selling user data](https://blog.couchsurfing.com/we-hear-you/); the users are (allegedly) not the product, and so cannot be sold. The last remaining revenue streams are essentially donations (which are difficult to solicit through a for-profit company), and advertising which did not generate enough revenue given the traffic to pay a team. A decrease from in usage and new user sign ups caused by the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated a long-standing issue at the core of the for-profit CouchSurfing.

Given no way to sufficiently monetize CouchSurfing in its original format, there was no choice but to compromise on the mission and to make space for profit. The company claims to have trialed [over 10 monetization strategies](https://blog.couchsurfing.com/we-hear-you/), ranging from more tailored advertising, commercial partnerships, and selling metchandise to more egregious ones such as allowing hosts to charge surfers, charging surfers a fee to confirm a stay, and — for some reason — even starting a cryptocurrency.

They eventually arrived at a verification fee model, where we can see [altered incentives playing out](incentives.md). Users could choose to "verify" their profile for a one time payment, adjusted for the location. To create an incentive to do this, a limit of 10 messages per week was impoced on unverified users, vastly [changing the dynamics](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/cho8ro/why_couchsurfing_is_dying/) of the platform. With limited messages, unverified surfers are more likely to message hosts who they believe will be more likely to host them -- hosts with tons of requests. Instead of a more even distribution of surfing requests throughout a city, this now cauced a concentration of requests to ["super-hosts"](incentives.md), disrupting the local host community.

With the verification model in place, the main way to make money was off the users, and so to maintain revenue targets, new users had to be pumped into the system and encouraged to buy verification. This ended the natural growth curve of CouchSurfing, and the platform was filled with people who didn't often get properly inducted? to the community.

We fundamentally believe there is no way to extract *monetary value* out of the types of interactions that CouchSurfing ought to facilitate even though they provide immense *societal value*. Compare it to a favor network: you surely have tens if not hundreds of friends who you could easily ask to help you move house for the morning and just buy them a few pizzas and some drinks as a token of appreciation. By doing so, you lean on your *social capital* through your network of friends, and you probably save either at least a day's worth of money hiring movers, or a day's worth of time going at it alone. There's no way you could write an app that makes money off this: it would either be weird (do you list all your skills on it?) or destroy the human touch of calling or messaging your friends (do you just choose what kind of service you need) and so they would be much less inclined to help you. This illustrates the concept of societal value, and how there are cases where even great societal value can be impossible to turn into monetary value.

Furthermore, it is almost impossible for the incentives to be aligned between app makers seeking a profit from app usage, and users of an app like CouchSurfing who are seeking to *not use the app* but be spending time with real humans. Maybe the best example to illustrate this point is Facebook. Being a large advertising company, they sell the *attention* of its users to advertisers. It is therefore a big win for them to make each user stay a few more minutes scrolling through their feed and hence looking at ads that translate to revenue for Facebook. The purpose of CouchSurfing, on the other hand, ought to be to get people to stop looking at the app, and instead meet up to hang out or surf with the amazing human being that they just connected with at the end of the platform.

Aapeli's point: Emphasise no value to be extracted, pure societal good. Other examples, favours

## Communities and Trust

Perhaps the biggest success of the early days of CouchSurfing was that it facilitated the interactions and formation of communities. Any word cloud of articles about CouchSurfing has "community" in huge letters at the center. Communities are usually divided into two:

 - Local communities: collections of people in cities or towns, usually made of a mix of hosts, stationary/working travellers and some of their friends
 - The global community: everyone that has participated and subscribes to the core value and ideals of non-transactional experiences

The global community expresses itself through articles and forums, through travellers and hosts staying in touch with each other, through members who share their experiences and encourage others to join, and in the past through the volunteer base that built the platform. The global community encapsulates the core philosophy, and so includes CouchSurfing, its competitors, Facebook groups, and people who host and surf offline or without apps.

Local communities are made up of individuals who love organising events and making travellers welcome. They provide their members with a sense of belonging, with friends and with a ton of fun. As probably every couch-surfer has experienced at some time or other: strong local communities are amazing to experience and be a part of.

The aim of an online service then becomes clear: serve and grow the global community, while creating and empowering local communities.

However, nothing about these communities in monetizable. You can't make a profit out of people being friends. You especially can't make a profit out of connecting people in a community whose central ethos is that not exchanging money is a key element of a fulfilling experience. We saw this play out through communities that were shunned in favour of the more monetizable elements. Forums were removed, with communities migrating onto places like Facebook and Reddit. Openness and transparency were gotten rid of, with the huge volunteer team collapsed to what is now a group of 25 employees. Hosting was solidified in cities and towns into a small group of [super-hosts](superhosts.md). The platform was flooded with new members in a way and rate that changed the dynamics of trust within community.

Couch-surfing is an experience that requires a huge degree of trust. Whether you are a host or surfer: you are in a vulnerable position. One of the core personality traits that binds the global community is the ability to trust strangers. There are two key concepts that are used to give users confidence to trust each other: reviews, which help users discern if people are good members of the community; and verification, which should prove that a user is who they say they are.

The review system has become a bit meaningless. The norm is to leave a good review, which is completely understandable, especially in situations where a host has generously let you stay in their home and treated you well. Bad (and previously neutral) reviews are reserved for extremely damning situations. There is a surface level problem in that whether you have a great experience or one that is just adequate, you'd usually give a positive review in either case, so reviews don't cater for capturing members who are a great asset to the community. More worryingly though, is that because people are hesitant to leave publically damning reviews, the threshold for them is far too high, and so the vast majority of negative (yet not absolutely horrid) experiences are never reported and do not factor into the public rating of a user. [People](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/coknjp/is_it_justified_to_post_this_negative_reference/) [are](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/erd3yl/should_i_write_a_negative_review_for_this_person/) [confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/fczu80/when_to_write_a_bad_review/) about when to write negative reviews, especially in situations where they are made to feel uncomfortable, but nothing has happened which could be objectively and undoubtedly pointed to for concrete evidence. In many situations, they might not leave a review, or sometimes even leave a good review. There is encouragement for people to use negative or neutral reviews more, but [incentives were never aligned to make them commonly used](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/214p4j/anyone_else_a_little_bothered_by_the_review/cg9mcq1/). The topic of the review system [being broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/bjsv7h/the_reference_system_of_cs_looks_somehow_broken/) comes up frequently, and has led people to [not trust reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/adlq58/recent_experiences_with_good_profiles_are_making/) to judge users, even if they [have many of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/7nzrxv/confused_about_people_who_had_bad_experiences/).

When CouchSurfing merged verification with its monetization method, it altered the meaning of verification. Currently, if someone has a 'verified' tag next to their name, it just means they have paid for the upgraded version of CouchSurfing, or earned it through hosting. Conversely, someone who doesn't pay cannot be verified, which is around 95% of the users. This has in effect removed verification as a method of trust.

You need trust for the communities and the users, not for the profits. The site has been fine generating revenue (pre-coronavirus) as it mostly relies on new signups. The profit incentives work to get people onto the site, but not improve the experience once they're on it. The erosion of trust has been fine for CouchSurfing as a company, but not for the health and longetivity of its communities.

## Creeps and Freeloaders

### Content warning: predatory behaviour and sexual assault and harassment

Free accomodation and sex sell. There are countless people who have been lured onto the site with the primary value proposition of a free place to sleep or an easy way to get laid. These people, unless they are corrected, are bad for the community. However, these value propositions bring people to the platform, and some of them will pay for verification. There is also no profit incentive for keeping people around.

It is widely known that CouchSurfing has a problem with creeps on the platform. While this behaviour occurs to and from all types of people, its most prevalent form is of men using the platform as a way to have sex with women. Of course, there will be many fully consensual sexual encounters as a result of connecting a lot of people in person, but there are many users for who this is the main or major reason they use the app. While many people might be comfortable handling themselves in situations with these kind of people, it has been a barrier to entry for joining, and has turned even experienced users away from CouchSurfing. The behaviour is so common that it even has its own term, SexSurfing.

It would be easy to write this off as a product of there being a lot of creepy people out there in the world, but there is a sentiment that over time, [this has gotten worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/7nzrxv/confused_about_people_who_had_bad_experiences/). CouchSurfing has also done very little to limit it. They may have instituted 'policies' that act as guidelines for people to follow, but this doesn't change the structure of how people interact with the app. This is likely that this is because it would destroy a major source of revenue.

In the most obvious case of creepy behaviour, it is extremely common for women to be inundated with [creepy requests and messages](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/2inf3j/okay_im_really_sick_of_people_using_cs_as_a/) from men. This is amplified when women [post public trips](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/5zmxgs/is_anyone_else_getting_creepy_messages_on/). There are many ways that CouchSurfing could approach fixing this. Automatic filters could control explicit messages. Users could have the option to alter message settings in different situations. For instance, someone could opt to not accept messages from unrated or unverified users that find them from public trips. However these aren't trivial to implement and don't yield profit.

Possibly more worrying is the more insidious case of users who act inappropriately only in person, after agreeing to meet up. There are countless stories of users who have been hit on by their hosts/surfers in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable. Users, especially men, do not recognise the power imbalance of those situations. The way this pans out is a spectrum of someone being comfortable handling the situation at one end to sexual assault at the other, with most cases falling somewhere in the middle. In some cases, people will just be uncomfortable and stick it out. In others, surfers will sleep with their hosts out of a sense of obligation. Although a technically consensual result, it will likely be a bad experience for the surfer, make them less trusting, and turn them away from couch-surfing. This kind of situation is widespread, it is not uncommon for women to be hit on by all of their male surfers/guests.
