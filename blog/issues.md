# What CouchSurfing got wrong



If you look through the forum posts that exist surrounding CouchSurfing or chat to long-time users, you'll come accross a conventional wisdom that CouchSurfing used to be amazing back in the 'heyday', usually pegged from the mid 2000s to early 2010s. Hosts and surfers enjoyed [rich, active communities](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/new-couchsurfing/), a phenomenon replicated accross the world and maintained by a volunteer workforce. In 2011, CouchSurfing files as a [for-profit company](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201206/issie-lapowsky/couchsurfing-new-profit-model.html), a decision frequently cited as the reason for the [decline of the community](https://www.nithincoca.com/2014/04/06/profit-couchsurfing-failed/). The number of users would continue to grow, enjoying a boom from around [2.5 million users](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jan/22/budget-travel-stay-with-locals) at the time to at least [12 million users](https://www.chicagotribune.com/real-estate/ct-re-chicago-couchsurfing-hosts-20180909-story.html) currently; however the community activity has seen a downturn and the platform has been overrun with creeps and travelers looking to score free accomodation, rather than looking for the genuine, non-transactional human experience that the forerunners sought to foster.

What was lost along the way was the influence, strength and moderation of communities, all on the back of atempting to monetize people's generosity. This created a whole bunch of inter-related problems with the platform.



## Profit and Incentives

Couchsurfing never should have been made a for-profit. While the founders may have seen no other choice, that point stands. There is certainly a moral dimension to driving profit from others' hospitality, this is clear from the outrage of experienced hosts at the recent decision of the CouchSurfing management to [force all users to pay for the service](https://medium.com/@jameshopest/the-death-of-couchsurfing-a87d9537edf2) and barring everyone from their accounts until they cough up, something they also [promised they would never do](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/gl9c3m/remember_when_they_promised_us_couchsurfing_would/). However, the more practical factors involved in the altered incentives of profit are more useful in seeing where CouchSurfing started to slip.

As much as the people working on the platform want to optimise for a great experience for as many people as possible, they are beholden to their VC investors. The platform would have to either optimise for profit, or at the very least be constrained by profit. This fact underlies every decision made by CouchSurfing since it was structured this way, and is confirmed by people [working on the project](https://hackernoon.com/should-couchsurfing-be-a-dao-6507646e34ef). As much as Silicon Valley would like to reject it, there are many ideas out there where profit would run against the incentives of making that idea successful. The practice of couch-surfing is one of those ideas. You cannot succesfully monetize its userbase while meeting the needs of its community.

CouchSurfing doesn't produce anything it can monetize, it is a messaging service. It cannot monetize the exchanges between its users as couch-surfing is a non-transactional practice. CouchSurfing has commited to [not selling user data](https://blog.couchsurfing.com/we-hear-you/); the users are not the product that can be sold. As a for-profit, CouchSurfing does not attract donations or volunteers which would improve their financial position. Given no way to monetize CouchSurfing in its original format, there was no choice but to compormise on the mission to make space for profit. They claim [over 10 monitization strategies](https://blog.couchsurfing.com/we-hear-you/) have been trialed, particularly egregious ones including allowing hosts to charge surfers, deepening advertising through commercial partnerships, charging surfers a fee to confirm a stay, and for some reason starting a cryptocurrency.

They eventually arrived at a verification fee model, where we can see altered incentives playing out. Users could choose to 'verify' their profile for a one time payment. To create an incentive to do this, they restricted the number of times unverified users could message to 10 times per week, vastly [changing the dynamics](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/cho8ro/why_couchsurfing_is_dying/) of the platform. With limited messages, unverified surfers are more likely to message hosts who they believe will be more likely to host them -- hosts with tons of requests. Instead of a more even distribution of surfing requests throughout a city, the incentive is now to concentrate requests to super-hosts, disrupting the local host community. 

With the verification model in place, the main way to make money was off the users, and so new users had to be pumped into the system and encouraged to buy verification. This ended the natural growth of CouchSurfing, and the platform was filled with people who didn't get it.


Aapeli's point: Emphasise no value to be extracted, pure societal good. Other examples, favours


## Communities and Trust

Perhaps the biggest success of the early days of CouchSurfing was the facilitation of communities. A word cloud of articles and forum posts written about CouchSurfing would have 'community' in huge letters. There are usually two ways they are referenced:
 - Local communities: collections of people in cities or towns, usually made of a mix of hosts, stationary/working travelers and some of their friends
 - Global community: everyone that has participated and subscribes to the core value of non-transactional experiences

The global community expresses itself through articles and forums, through travelers and hosts staying in touch with each other, through members who share their experiences and encourage others to join, and in the past through the volunteer base that built the platform. The global community encapsulates the core philosophy, and so includes Couchsurfing, its competitors, facebook groups, and people who host and surf without using apps.

Strong local communities are amazing to experience. They are filled with people who love organising events and making travelers welcome. They provide their members with a sense of belonging, with friends and with a ton of fun.

The aim of an online service becomes clear: Serve and grow the global community, Create and empower local communities.

However nothing about these communities in monetizable. You can't make a profit out of people being friends. You especially can't make a profit out of connecting people who believe that not exchanging money is a key element of a fulfilling experience. Communities were shunned in favour of the more monitizable elements. Forums were removed, with communities migrating onto places like Facebook and Reddit. Openness and transparency were gotten rid of, with the huge volunteer team collapsed to what is now a group of 25 employees. Hosting was solidified in cities and towns into a small group of super-hosts. The platform was flooded with new members in a way and rate that changed the dynamics as trust in other members decreased.

Couch-surfing is an experience that requires a huge degree of trust. Whether you are a host or surfer you are in a vulnerable position. One of the core personality traits that binds the global community is the ability to trust strangers. There are two key concepts that are used to give users confidence to trust each other: reviews, which help users descern if people are good members of the community, and verification, which should prove that a user is who they say they are. 

The review system created has become a bit meaningless. The norm is to leave a good review, which is completely understandable especially in situations where a host has generously let you stay in their home. Bad (and previously neutral) reviews are reserved for extremely damning situations. There is a surface level problem in that whether you have a great experience or one that is just ok, you'd usually give a positive review in either case, so reviews don't cater for capturing members who are a great asset to the community. More worryingly though, is that because people are hesitant to leave publically damning reviews, the threshhold for them is far too high. [People](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/coknjp/is_it_justified_to_post_this_negative_reference/) [are](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/erd3yl/should_i_write_a_negative_review_for_this_person/) [confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/fczu80/when_to_write_a_bad_review/) about when to write negative reviews, especially in situations where they are made to feel uncomforable despite nothing specifically happening. In many situations, they may leave a good review or at the very least leave none. There is encouragement for people to use negative or neutral reviews more, but [incentives were never aligned to make them commonly used](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/214p4j/anyone_else_a_little_bothered_by_the_review/cg9mcq1/). The topic of the review system [being broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/bjsv7h/the_reference_system_of_cs_looks_somehow_broken/) comes up frequently, and has led people to [not trust reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/adlq58/recent_experiences_with_good_profiles_are_making/) even if they [have many](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/7nzrxv/confused_about_people_who_had_bad_experiences/).

When CouchSurfing merged verification with its monitisation method, it altered the meaning of verification. Currently, if someone has a 'verified' tag next to their name, it just means they have paid for the upgraded version of CouchSurfing, or earned it through hosting. Conversely, someone who doesn't pay cannot be verified, which is around 95% of the users. This has in effect removed verification as a method of trust.

You need trust for the communities and the users, not for the profits. The site has been fine generating revenue (pre-coronavirus) as it mostly relies on new signups. The profit incentives work to get people onto the site, but not improve the experience once they're on it. The erosion of trust has been fine for CouchSurfing, but not for its communities.

## Creeps and Freeloaders

### Content warning: predatory behaviour and sexual assault and harrassment

Free accomodation and sex sell. There are countless people who have been lured onto the site with the primary value proposition of a free place to sleep or an easy way to get laid. These people, unless they are corrected, are bad for the community. However, these value propositions bring people to the platform, and some of them will pay for verification. There is also no profit incentive for keeping people around.

It is widely known that CouchSurfing has a problem with creeps on the platform. While this behaviour occurs to and from all types of people, it's most prevalent form is of men using the platform as a way to have sex with women. Of course, there will be many fully consensual sexual encounters as a result of connecting a lot of people in person, but there are many users for who this is the main or major reason they use the app. While many people might be comfortable handling themselves in situations with these kind of people, it has been a barrier to entry for joining, and has turned even experienced users away from CouchSurfing. The behaviour is so common that it even has its own term, SexSurfing.

It would be easy to write this off as a product of there being a lot of creepy people out there in the world, but there is a sentiment that over time, [this has gotten worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/7nzrxv/confused_about_people_who_had_bad_experiences/). CouchSurfing has also done very little to limit it. They may have instituted 'policies' that act as guidelines for people to follow, but this doesn't change the structure of how people interact with the app. This is likely that this is because it would destroy a major source of revenue.

In the most obvious case of creepy behaviour, it is extremely common for women to be inundated with [creepy requests and messages](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/2inf3j/okay_im_really_sick_of_people_using_cs_as_a/) from men. This is amplified when women [post public trips](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/5zmxgs/is_anyone_else_getting_creepy_messages_on/). There are many ways that CouchSurfing could approach fixing this. Automatic filters could control explicit messages. Users could have the option to alter message settings in different situations. For instance, someone could opt to not accept messages from unrated or unverified users that find them from public trips. However these aren't trivial to implement and don't yield profit.

Possibly more worrying is the more insidious case of users who act inapropriately only in person, after agreeing to meet up. There are countless stories of users who have been hit on by their hosts/surfers in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable. Users, especially men, do not recognise the power inbalance of those situations. The way this pans out is a spectrum of someone being comfortable handling the situation at one end to sexual assault at the other, with most cases falling somewhere in the middle. In some cases, people will just be uncomfortable and stick it out. In others, surfers will sleep with their hosts out of a sense of obligation. Although a technically consensual result, it will likely be a bad experience for the surfer, make them less trusting, and turn them away from couch-surfing. This kind of situation is widespread, it is not uncommon for women to be hit on by all of their male surfers/guests.
