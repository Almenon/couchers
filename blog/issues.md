# What CouchSurfing got wrong



If you trawl through the tons of forum posts that exist surrounding CouchSurfing or chat to long-time users, you'll come accross a conventional wisdom that CouchSurfing used to be amazing back in the 'heyday', usually pegged from the mid 2000s to early 2010s. Hosts and surfers enjoyed [rich, active communities](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/new-couchsurfing/), a phenomenon replicated accross the world and maintained by a volunteer workforce. In 2011, CouchSurfing files as a [for-profit company](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201206/issie-lapowsky/couchsurfing-new-profit-model.html), a decision frequently sited as the reason for the [decline of the community](https://www.nithincoca.com/2014/04/06/profit-couchsurfing-failed/). The number of users would continue to grow, enjoying a boom from around [2.5 million users](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jan/22/budget-travel-stay-with-locals) at the time to at least [12 million users](https://www.chicagotribune.com/real-estate/ct-re-chicago-couchsurfing-hosts-20180909-story.html) currently; however the community activity has seen a downturn and the platform has been overrun with creeps and travelers looking to score free accomodation, rather than looking for the genuine, non-transactional human experience that the forerunners sought to foster.

What was lost along the way was the influence, strenghth and moderation of communities, all on the back of atempting to monetize people's generosity. This created a whole bunch of inter-related problems with the platform.



## Profit and Incentives

Couchsurfing never should have been made a for-profit. While the founders may have seen no other choice, that point stands. There is certainly a moral dimension to driving profit from others' hospitality, this is clear from the outrage of experienced hosts at the recent decision of the CouchSurfing management to [force all users to pay for the service](https://medium.com/@jameshopest/the-death-of-couchsurfing-a87d9537edf2) and barring everyone from their accounts until they cough up, something they also [promised they would never do](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/gl9c3m/remember_when_they_promised_us_couchsurfing_would/). However, the more practical factors involved in the altered incentives of profit are more useful in seeing where CouchSurfing started to slip.

As much as the people working on the platform want to optimise for a great experience for as many people as possible, they are beholden to their VC investors. The platform would have to either optimise for profit, or at the very least be constrained by profit. This fact underlies every decision made by CouchSurfing since it was structured this way, and is confirmed by people [working on the project](https://hackernoon.com/should-couchsurfing-be-a-dao-6507646e34ef). As much as Silicon Valley would like to reject it, there are many ideas out there where profit would run against the incentives of making that idea successful. The practice of couch-surfing is one of those ideas. You cannot succesfully monetize its userbase while meeting the needs of its community.

CouchSurfing doesn't produce anything it can monetize, it is a messaging service. It cannot monetize the exchanges between its users as couch-surfing is a non-transactional practice. CouchSurfing has commited to [not selling user data](https://blog.couchsurfing.com/we-hear-you/); the users are not the product that can be sold. As a for-profit, CouchSurfing does not attract donations or volunteers which would improve their financial position. Given no way to monetize CouchSurfing in its original format, there was no choice but to compormise on the mission to make space for profit. They claim [over 10 monitization strategies](https://blog.couchsurfing.com/we-hear-you/) have been trialed, particularly egregious ones including allowing hosts to charge surfers, deepening advertising through commercial partnerships, charging surfers a fee to confirm a stay, and for some reason starting a cryptocurrency.

They eventually arrived at a verification fee model, where we can see altered incentives playing out. Users could choose to 'verify' their profile for a one time payment. To create an incentive to do this, they restricted the number of times unverified users could message to 10 times per week, vastly [changing the dynamics](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/cho8ro/why_couchsurfing_is_dying/) of the platform. With limited messages, unverified surfers are more likely to message hosts who they believe will be more likely to host them, hosts with tons of requests. Instead of a more even distribution of surfing requests throughout a city, the incentive is now to concentrate requests to super-hosts, disrupting the local host community. With this structure in place, the main way to make money is off the users.
