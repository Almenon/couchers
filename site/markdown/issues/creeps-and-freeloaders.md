### Content warning: predatory behaviour, sexual assault and harassment

Free accomodation and sex sell. There are countless people who have been lured onto the site with the primary value proposition of a free place to sleep or an easy way to get laid. These people, unless they are corrected, are bad for the community and turn people away. However, the [profit incentives](/issues/profit-and-incentives) are badly aligned. These value propositions bring people to the platform, and some of them will pay for verification. There is also no profit in keeping good people around.

It is widely known that CouchSurfing has a problem with creeps on the platform. While this behaviour occurs to and from all types of people, its most prevalent form is of men using the platform as a way to have sex with women. Of course, there will be many fully consensual sexual encounters as a result of connecting a lot of people in person, but there are many users for who this is the main or major reason they use the app. While many people might be comfortable handling themselves in situations with these kind of people, it has been a barrier to entry for joining, and has turned even experienced users away from CouchSurfing. The behaviour is so common that it even has its own term, SexSurfing. To be clear, sex is not bad for the community, but users' expectation of sex is, as well as sexually inapropriate behaviour that makes people feel uncomfortable.

It would be easy to write this off as a product of there being a lot of creepy people out there in the world, but there is a sentiment that over time, [this has gotten worse](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/7nzrxv/confused_about_people_who_had_bad_experiences/). CouchSurfing has also done very little to limit it. They may have instituted [policies](https://www.couchsurfing.com/about/policies/) that act as guidelines for people to follow, but this doesn't change the structure of how people interact with the app. This is likely that this is because it would destroy a major source of revenue.

In the most obvious case of creepy behaviour, it is extremely common for women to be inundated with [creepy requests and messages](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/2inf3j/okay_im_really_sick_of_people_using_cs_as_a/) from men. This is amplified when women [post public trips](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/5zmxgs/is_anyone_else_getting_creepy_messages_on/). There are many ways that CouchSurfing could approach fixing this. Automatic filters could control explicit messages. Users could have the option to alter message settings in different situations. For instance, someone could opt to not accept messages from unrated or unverified users that find them from public trips. However these aren't trivial to implement and don't yield profit.


Possibly more worrying is the more insidious case of users who act inapropriately only in person, after agreeing to meet up. In some situations this behaviour can be predicted, for instance the prevalence of male accounts which only have references from young, attractive women. However, often it is too hard to predict given the information CouchSurfing provides you. There are even individuals and groups that advocate for this kind of [predatory behaviour](https://mavericktraveler.com/how-to-bang-couchsurfing-girls-the-complete-guide/). There are countless stories of users who have been hit on by their hosts/surfers in a way that makes them feel uncomfortable. Users, especially men, do not recognise the power inbalance of those situations. Guests who feel uncomfortable are not able to leave as they are reliant on accomodation. Hosts who feel uncomfortable may be too reluctant to kick the surfer out as they feel an obligation to the surfer who is reliant on them. The way this pans out is a spectrum of someone being comfortable handling the situation at one end to [sexual assault](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/7k3ixp/i_got_raped_by_my_couchsurfing_host_and_i_need/) at the other, with most cases falling somewhere in the middle. In some cases, people will just be uncomfortable and stick it out. In others, surfers will sleep with their hosts out of a sense of obligation. Although a technically consensual result, it will likely be a bad experience for the surfer, make them less trusting, and turn them away from couch-surfing. This kind of situation is widespread, and it is not uncommon for women to be hit on by the [majority of their male hosts/surfers](https://www.reddit.com/r/solotravel/comments/6xrymf/where_did_all_the_normal_couchsurfers_go/dmi24r1/).

Women being turned away from CouchSurfing has caused various negative feedback loops. Women may for safety reasons only want to surf with female hosts. Less women on the platform means less female hosts, and this will lead to less female surfers. This has also decreased the power of women in the global and local communities. Due to the number of male hosts who only host women compounded with the [super-host effect](/issues/host-matching) has meant that in many places the only hosts available are these predatory hosts, [limiting the options of women further to those hosts](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/5f6ofd/rant_couchsurfing_is_not_tinder/), and causing a side-effect where men can't find hosts.

The issue again comes back to the degrading of communities. Strong communities not only give a wider variety of hosts, but have accountability. When local forums existed, visitors were warned away from predatory hosts. People's actions in the community were broadcasted by their community. Users expressed opinions in public, and you could stay with people based on those opinions. Their actions did not exist inside a bubble. While it may have not been the optimal way to hold people accountable, a system existed. Then it was destroyed and we were left only with a review system that does not incentivise users to leave the negative reviews necessary.

The freeloader problem, although not comparable in negative experiences for members, is similar. Many people sign up purely as a way to get free accomodation. A good member of CouchSurfing will surf because they want personal, local and community experiences in a non-transactional setting. Free accomodation is part of that, or at most a way to remove the monetary barrier to entry. The classic freeloader is only in it for the free accomodation, and is uninterested by the other elements such as interacting with their host. Similarly, profit motives for CouchSurfing want them to attract this large market especially as they do not host, and so are more inclined to buy verification. There is also limited accountability here as many hosts will be inclined to leave positive or no references for these people, even if they've had a bad experience.
