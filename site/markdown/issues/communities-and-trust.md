title: Communities and Trust
---

Perhaps the biggest success of the early days of CouchSurfing was that it facilitated the interactions and formation of communities. Any word cloud of articles about CouchSurfing has "community" in huge letters at the center. Communities are usually divided into two:

 - Local communities: collections of people in cities or towns, usually made of a mix of hosts, stationary/working travellers and some of their friends
 - The global community: everyone that has participated and subscribes to the core value and ideals of non-transactional experiences

The global community expresses itself through articles and forums, through travellers and hosts staying in touch with each other, through members who share their experiences and encourage others to join, and in the past through the volunteer base that built the platform. The global community encapsulates the core philosophy, and so includes CouchSurfing, its competitors, Facebook groups, and people who host and surf offline or without apps.

Local communities are made up of individuals who love organising events and making travellers welcome. They provide their members with a sense of belonging, with friends and with a ton of fun. As probably every couch-surfer has experienced at some time or other: strong local communities are amazing to experience and be a part of.

The aim of an online service then becomes clear: serve and grow the global community, while creating and empowering local communities.

However, nothing about these communities in monetizable. You can't make a profit out of people being friends. You especially can't make a profit out of connecting people in a community whose central ethos is that not exchanging money is a key element of a fulfilling experience. We saw this play out through communities that were shunned in favour of the more monetizable elements. Forums were removed, with communities migrating onto places like Facebook and Reddit. Openness and transparency were gotten rid of, with the huge volunteer team collapsed to what is now a group of 25 employees. Hosting was solidified in cities and towns into a small group of [super-hosts](/issues/host-matching). The platform was flooded with new members in a way and rate that changed the dynamics of trust within community.

Couch-surfing is an experience that requires a huge degree of trust. Whether you are a host or surfer: you are in a vulnerable position. One of the core personality traits that binds the global community is the ability to trust strangers. There are two key concepts that are used to give users confidence to trust each other: reviews, which help users discern if people are good members of the community; and verification, which should prove that a user is who they say they are.

The review system has become a bit meaningless. The norm is to leave a good review, which is completely understandable, especially in situations where a host has generously let you stay in their home and treated you well. Bad (and previously neutral) reviews are reserved for extremely damning situations. There is a surface level problem in that whether you have a great experience or one that is just adequate, you'd usually give a positive review in either case, so reviews don't cater for capturing members who are a great asset to the community. More worryingly though, is that because people are hesitant to leave publically damning reviews, the threshold for them is far too high, and so the vast majority of negative (yet not absolutely horrid) experiences are never reported and do not factor into the public rating of a user. [People](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/coknjp/is_it_justified_to_post_this_negative_reference/) [are](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/erd3yl/should_i_write_a_negative_review_for_this_person/) [confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/fczu80/when_to_write_a_bad_review/) about when to write negative reviews, especially in situations where they are made to feel uncomfortable, but nothing has happened which could be objectively and undoubtedly pointed to for concrete evidence. In many situations, they might not leave a review, or sometimes even leave a good review. There is encouragement for people to use negative or neutral reviews more, but [incentives were never aligned to make them commonly used](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/214p4j/anyone_else_a_little_bothered_by_the_review/cg9mcq1/). The topic of the review system [being broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/bjsv7h/the_reference_system_of_cs_looks_somehow_broken/) comes up frequently, and has led people to [not trust reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/adlq58/recent_experiences_with_good_profiles_are_making/) to judge users, even if they [have many of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/7nzrxv/confused_about_people_who_had_bad_experiences/).


(review with how I explained it to Marlies)

When CouchSurfing merged verification with its monetization method, it altered the meaning of verification. Currently, if someone has a 'verified' tag next to their name, it just means they have paid for the upgraded version of CouchSurfing, or earned it through hosting. Conversely, someone who doesn't pay cannot be verified, which is around 95% of the users. This has in effect removed verification as a method of trust.


You need trust for the communities and the users, not for the profits. The site has been fine generating revenue (pre-coronavirus) as it mostly relies on new signups. The profit incentives work to get people onto the site, but not improve the experience once they're on it. The erosion of trust has been fine for CouchSurfing as a company, but not for the health and longetivity of its communities.

(Advertising relies on people staying on the app, we may not necessarily want that)
