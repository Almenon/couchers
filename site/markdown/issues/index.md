title: What CouchSurfing got wrong
---

If you look through the forum posts discussing CouchSurfing or chat to long-time users, you'll come across a conventional wisdom that CouchSurfing used to be amazing back in the "heyday"; usually pegged from the mid 2000s to the early 2010s. Hosts and surfers enjoyed [rich, active communities](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/new-couchsurfing/), a phenomenon replicated across the world and maintained by a volunteer workforce. In 2011, CouchSurfing filed as a [for-profit company](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201206/issie-lapowsky/couchsurfing-new-profit-model.html), a decision frequently cited as the start of the [decline of the community](https://www.nithincoca.com/2014/04/06/profit-couchsurfing-failed/). The number of users continued to grow, enjoying a boom from around [2.5 million users](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jan/22/budget-travel-stay-with-locals) at the time, to at least [12 million users](https://www.chicagotribune.com/real-estate/ct-re-chicago-couchsurfing-hosts-20180909-story.html) currently. However, the reality is that the community activity has seen a downturn and the platform has been overrun by creeps and travellers looking to score free accomodation, rather than looking for the genuine, non-transactional human experience that the forerunners sought to foster.

What was lost along the way was the influence, strength and moderation of communities. This was thrown away to be replace dby an attempt to monetize people's generosity. This created a number of inter-related problems within the platform, percolating into the community and into the whole couch-surfing experience.
