title: The Reference System
---

The reference system used by CouchSurfing may seem simple and intuitive on the surface, but it fails to do its job. People read references for two main reasons: to make sure their experience is safe and enjoyable. However, given the way the reference system is structured, it doesn't achieve either of those goals and so the system is meaningless.

In general, a good user acount is one that only has positive reviews. Negative (and previously neutral) reviews are seen as a big red flag. The norm is to leave a good review, which is completely understandable, especially in situations where a host has generously let you stay in their home and treated you well. However there's a problem here in that it's hard to distinguish between an average experience or an amazing experience with someone who's a great asset to the community. Most references are similarly positive, and so it's very hard to gague whether you think you'll have an enjoyable experience with another person. But the larger problem is in how uncommon negative reviews are. What this has done is consolidated members onto the 100% positive bracket whether they are amazing contributers to the community or detract from it. There's no way to tell from references.

The threshhold for how bad an experience must be for someone to justify leaving a bad review is far too high, and so the vast majority of negative experiences are never reported, and so do not factor into the public references. [People](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/coknjp/is_it_justified_to_post_this_negative_reference/) [are](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/erd3yl/should_i_write_a_negative_review_for_this_person/) [confused](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/fczu80/when_to_write_a_bad_review/) about when to write negative reviews, especially in situations where they are made to feel uncomfortable. In many situations, they might not leave a review, or sometimes even leave a good review. There is encouragement for people to use negative or neutral reviews more, but [incentives were never aligned to make them commonly used](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/214p4j/anyone_else_a_little_bothered_by_the_review/cg9mcq1/). The topic of the reference system [being broken](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/bjsv7h/the_reference_system_of_cs_looks_somehow_broken/) comes up frequently, and has led people to [not trust reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/adlq58/recent_experiences_with_good_profiles_are_making/) to judge users, even if they [have many of them](https://www.reddit.com/r/couchsurfing/comments/7nzrxv/confused_about_people_who_had_bad_experiences/). This is an issue as it means that the reference system does [not make people accountable](/issues/creeps-and-freeloaders). 

Negative reviews are seen as a big punishment, and people feel uncomfortable punishing others. Often in these cases, a negative review seems disproportionate to a problem that might not have been 'that bad' (for instance they were made to feel a bit uncomfortable). The problem here is that negative references are stigmatised. It is the norm for users to have 100% positive reviews, any lower and it is much harder to meet people. There is a huge difference between 100% and 98%. If people's scores were normally in the 60-80% region, then giving a negative review wouldn't be that big of a deal. There's not that much of a difference between 75% and 73%. 

People are afraid of retribution. It is very intimidating to leave a publically negative review, especially when they're so stigmatised. Although CouchSurfing doesn't publish references until both parties have made them, it can still unnerve people and there may be a fear of confrontation or retaliation if they see that person again, or if they themselves are left a negative public review in response. There needs to be anonymous ways to signal a bad experience.
