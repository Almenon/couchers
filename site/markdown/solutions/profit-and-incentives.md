## Structure

The profit structure that Couchsurfing&#8482; uses simply doesn't work. Building this next iteration of couch-surfing, we can — and have to — choose something better that guarantees the long-term future of the shared resource. Trying to make a profit out of couch-surfing is a bad idea because it undermines the societal good by distorting the incentives and because the experience of couch-surfing is fundamentally non-monetizable. The only sense here is to structure it as a non-profit. However, we still need to deal with a revenue model to cover the costs of hosting and other expenses.

There are advantages in a non-profit model for keeping costs down. **Most importantly, we take no capital investment so there is no need to create profit to channel to investors at any point down the line.** We will also be able to attract volunteers who believe in the societal benefit of this project more easily.

We are actively [exploring the right legal and community structure](/governance) to make this work.

## Revenue

There are different revenue models that we can adopt. They all have their advantages and disadvantages. Any decisions or later changes here will be made in full consultation with the community, as it fundamentally defines the incentives that run into the platform.

### Donations

We hope to attract donations from users of this platform. Many users of Couchsurfing&#8482; have expressed that they would rather pay donations than the forced contributions that have now been demanded. Donations are an excellent source of income in that they incentivise the platform into making a better experience for its users. The better the experience, the more likely it is that they donate. Furthermore, we believe that letting people pay what they want may allow some to make larger contributions, unlikely under a fixed price scheme. The downside is donations can be unpredictable and unreliable.

### Grants

We may be able to find organisations or government programs that offer grants to non-profits. However, they may prove extremely difficult to find, take substantial effort and time to secure, require some fulfilment by the platform, and may just be a one-off payment.

### Advertising

An option available is to run ads on the website and phone apps. This is a common approach for many free online services because it is a predictable, reliable income stream. The downsides are that it interferes to some degree with the usability of the service as ads are annoying, and companies trying to get users' money runs against the ethos of couch-surfing.

### Co-operative structure

An interesting option that is often brought up is the idea of running a platform like this as a co-op. Users could voluntarily buy ownership of the platform as a one-off or subscription payment, allowing them to vote on decisions or leaders. You can see the enthusiasm for this idea on the [comments of Couchsurfing&#8482;'s official response to the outrage over the forced contributions](https://blog.couchsurfing.com/we-hear-you/#comments). The upsides are that the platform would be entirely community-owned, and so the incentives would run in direct line with the community, and that it can be a more reliable and substantial form of capital than donations. Potential downsides are that it may be hard to predict the dynamics of widespread ownership (for instance an undesired political element may evolve), and it may disadvantage users or countries with less disposable income.
