# Revenue Models

It is clear that the [profit structure](/issues/profit-and-incentives) that CouchSurfing uses doesn't work. Building this next iteration of couch-surfing, we can choose something better. Trying to make a profit out of couch-surfing is a bad idea, because it undermines the societal good by distorting the incentives and because it fundamentally isn't monetizable. The only sense here is to structure it as a non-profit. However we still need to deal with a revenue model to cover the costs.

There are advantages in a non-profit model for keeping costs down. Most importantly, we take no capital investment and so there is no need to create profit to chanel to investors at any point down the line. We will also be able to attract volunteers who believe in the societal benefit of this project.

There are different revenue models that we can adopt. They all have their advantages and disadvantages. Any decisions or later changes here will be made in full consultation with the community, as it fundamentally defines the incentives that run into the platform.

### Donations

We hope to attract donations from users of this platform. Many users of CouchSurfing have expressed that they would rather pay donations rather than the forced contributions that have been demanded now. Donations are an excellent source of income in that they incentivise the platform into making a better experience for its users. The better the experience, the more likely it is that they donate. The downside is they can be unpredictable and unreliable.


### Advertising and selling user data

An option available is to run ads on the website and phone apps. This is a common approach for many free online services because it is a predictable, reliable income stream. The downsides are that it interferes to some degree with the usability of the service, ads are annoying, and companies trying to get users' money runs against the ethos of couch-surfing. Similarly, user data could be sold to advertising companies. There is a slightly worrying clash of incentives here in that advertising revenue increases with the time that users spend on the app, whereas that is not be a goal of this platform, and may even run counter to its goals.


### Co-operative structure

An interesting option that is often brought up is the idea of running a platform such as this as a co-op. Users could voluntarily buy ownership of the platform as a one-off or subscription payment, allowing them to vote on decisions or leaders. You can see the enthusiasm for this idea on the [comments of CouchSurfing's official response to the outrage over the forced contributions](https://blog.couchsurfing.com/we-hear-you/#comments). The upsides are that the platform is entirely community owned, and so the incentives will run in direct line with the community, and that it can be a more reliable and substantial form of revenue than donations. Potential downsides are that it may be hard to predict the dynamics of widespread ownership (for instance a large political element may evolve that may not be desirable), and it may disadvantage users or countries with less disposable income.
