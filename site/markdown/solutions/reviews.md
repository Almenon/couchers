title: "Community Standing: Improving the Reference System"
---

Trust is critical to the couch-surfing community. Our trust model is based on two important measures on users' profiles: Community Verification and Community Standing. Community Standing helps users understand your positive contributions to the community and indicates whether people have found you safe to be around. Verification tells users whether to trust who you say you are. You can read about the [new verification system here](/solutions/communities-and-trust).

## The community standing score

The following outlines our current plan on how to create the community standing score. We don't believe in forever locking it down, and want to try a few different things in the future to perfect it, but what follows is a preliminary overview of what we're planning right now.

When you interact with another user, you will be encouraged to review them. You will be prompted with 3 quick questions:

1. Would you recommend this person to other members?
2. Does this individual contribute positively to the community?
3. Did this person talk or act in any way that made you feel safe or comfortable?

You will then be prompted to write a reference where you can detail your experience. When both references are written, they are published publically on each other's accounts.

The answers to the three questions, on the other hand, are kept private and used to calculate the user's community standing score. The score takes into account each set of answers and time, so that old reviews count less. Some randomness is introduced into the system in terms of timing and altering scores so that it is hard to tell if a certain person has left you a bad review. If you receive positive answers to the questions, your score will go up.

When looking at another member's score you can expect an average score of around 70%. You can also filter the score by sub-communities. For instance, you may wish to see how someone is regarded in their home community or with older people. Women  may be interested in seeig if other women found a host safe to be around.

## Rationale

A simple positive/negative recommendation is flawed. [Negative reviews are rare](/issues/reviews) which makes it [hard for users, especially women to have confidence in their safety](/issues/creeps-and-freeloaders) and this system lends itself to the [super-host effect](/issues/host-matching), where very few hosts do most of the hosting even though others want to, polarising the community.

We want the new reference score to have a few properties:

- If you are a good member of the community, you should be able to increase your score by interacting with more users
- Negative reviews must be destigmatised and more common
- The system must be simple
- The score must be calculated from questions where the member answering believes they are anonymous

These points are ticked off by our system. We destigmatise negative reviews by moving the goalposts from expecting everyone to be 100% as it is in CouchSurfing to putting people around 60-80% on average. People won't feel so bad about moving someone down from a 78% to a 76% if they've done something wrong. On the other hand, if a person frequently makes others feel unsafe or uncomfortable, you can expect that they'll have very low scores.

We will introduce a new score, Community Standing, which will measure how much other people in the community trust you and have found your company to be a positive experience. While we will still have references available, the number of references will not be the main indicator when choosing another member to surf, host or hang out with.

If someone is a great member of the community, such as an amazing host or organiser, this will be reflected in their scores. We hope this will incentivise users to become more active in their communities.
