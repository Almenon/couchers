title: Better ways to find hosts
---

For the new system of searching for hosts, we want to achieve two things
 1. making it easier to find people you will want to stay with
 2. spreading hosting amongst more people to negate the [super-host effect](/issues/host-matching)

There will be no cap to the number of messages you can send. This will mean that you won't rely on 2 or 3 messages so you can send to a more varied group including people with fewer references. We will still incentivise personalised requests so this system isn't abused.

Search ranking will be based on [community standing score](/solutions/reviews) rather than number of reviews. Hosts of very different experience levels may have similar scores, and this will allow hosting to be done by more people, expanding the community. Searches will also be ranked to some extent based on keyword matchings in your profiles and references. We don't want to encourage similarity too much because there is value in meeting a large variety of people. You will also be given more flexibility in choice with more detailed filters on your searches.
