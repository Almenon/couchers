## How will you prevent this platform from ever becoming a for-profit like CouchSurfing did?

We strongly believe that driving profit out of couch-surfing is a bad idea. It would [introduce incentives that damage the community](/issues/profit-and-incentives) and would not make financial sense as this idea based on non-transactional experiences is not monetizable. This is about societal value, not monetary value.

While we haven't solidified the plan just yet, the plan is to [build the community into the functioning](/solutions/communities-and-trust), and you can look at some potential ideas for how we'll achieve this in our [governance models](/governance). We do encourage you to sign up and contribute ideas for how we can achieve this as best as possible.


## Why don't you just work with any of the other non-profit platforms?

We are approaching this from a different angle. BeWelcome and TrustRoots have built platforms that are functionally different from CouchSurfing. Our aim is to build something that is more similar to CouchSurfing in its functionality (hosting, surfing, hangouts, events, etc. in a convenient app), but is modernised, far better designed and built, and with the community interests as the main priority.

There are also some core ideas that we want to build into the foundations, and that requires something new. We fundamentally believe that some of the actions taken by CouchSurfing in the design of its platform have damaged communities, but we also believe that the reverse can also be true. With good architecture and design we can encourage healthy communities, user's safety, filter out creeps and freeloaders and make the experience a better one to use. You can read about our [ideas for the design](/solutions/index) to achieve this.


## How do you plan on funding this? Doesn't it cost a lot of money?

There are three main costs that CouchSurfing needs to cover that we will need to replicate:
 1. Moderators (following up on reports about bad user behaviour, etc)
 2. Developers
 3. Server hosting

We believe moderation can be built into the system where necessary so that more trusted members of the community can take charge of moderation actions, and we can rely on the volunteer efforts of moderators. This method is cost-effective, scalable and cements communities into the functioning of the platform.

On the development end, we will initially handle the build and development of the platform ourselves and have committed time to complete it. Over time, we wish to onboard more volunteers, and as time goes by, hope to hand over a number of development and maintenance tasks to individuals from the community, according to our [governance model](/governance).

Server hosting will be our main cost, but we believe we will easily be able to cover the cost of hosting through donations from the community, and we also believe CouchSurfing is [built poorly](/issues/the-build) increasing the hosting costs probably by an order of magnitude.


## How can you remain competitive or even build something good if you're so focused on not making money?

There are many companies that are not profit-seeking that perform far better than their competitors and provide great societal value including Wikipedia, TED, Khan Academy and the Red Cross (go donate some blood).


## When do you think this will be ready to launch?

We have a bit of flexibility as people aren't travelling so much right now. Our aim is to have it ready by the time people are moving again.
