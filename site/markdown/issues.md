title: What CouchSurfing got wrong
---

We have had amazing experiences using CouchSurfing. For many people, it brought them into communities and provided them with great interactions with other people. There is still a lot of love and loyalty for CouchSurfing, even amongst the people working on this project. That being said, it definitely has its issues. Here, we go into a deep dive on those problems before addressing them in [our improvements](/solutions).

If you look through the forum posts discussing CouchSurfing or chat to long-time users, you'll come across the conventional wisdom that CouchSurfing used to be amazing back in the "heyday"; usually pegged from the mid 2000s to the early 2010s. Hosts and surfers enjoyed [rich, active communities](https://www.dailydot.com/debug/new-couchsurfing/), a phenomenon replicated across the world and maintained by a volunteer workforce. In 2011, CouchSurfing filed as a [for-profit company](https://www.inc.com/magazine/201206/issie-lapowsky/couchsurfing-new-profit-model.html), a decision frequently cited as the start of the [decline of the community](https://www.nithincoca.com/2014/04/06/profit-couchsurfing-failed/). The number of users continued to grow, enjoying a boom from around [2.5 million users](https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/jan/22/budget-travel-stay-with-locals) at the time, to at least [12 million users](https://www.chicagotribune.com/real-estate/ct-re-chicago-couchsurfing-hosts-20180909-story.html) currently. However, the reality is that the community activity has seen a downturn and the platform has been overrun by creeps and travellers looking to score free accommodation, rather than looking for the genuine, non-transactional human experience that the forerunners sought to foster.

What was lost along the way was the influence, strength and moderation of communities. This was thrown away to be replaced by an attempt to monetize people's generosity. This created several inter-related problems within the platform, percolating into the community and the whole couch-surfing experience.

## The Issues

Here are the largest issues we've identified with the CouchSurfing platform.

### [Profit incentives](/issues/profit-and-incentives)

CouchSurfing changed into a for-profit company, and in doing so introduced new incentives for the platform that damaged the community. Critically, these involved trying to get anyone new onto the platform for the verification revenue, putting in restrictions on number of messages, and not putting effort into preserving communities and keeping good members.
