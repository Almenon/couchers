title: Governance Models
---

We are developing a roadmap of deciding on how to run this platform. Community will be at the center of the platform, so people will need to be consulted in that decision.

We are confident that the site can be run without needing to seek mandatory payments from users, however this will require community involvement at several levels as volunteer work.

We will need developers, designers, UI/UX engineers and all kinds of people experienced with community non-profits. On the community side we will need hosts, surfers and community organisers that will help in setting the direction. In the coming weeks we will expand to include more of these people, and grow this network with their guidance and expertise.

Volunteers will be needed to perform moderation tasks. Tasks may include moderating forums and reviewing messages that have been tagged as inapropriate.

## Models

There are many potential ways to structure this organisation. We have listed a few examples below, but will ultimately consult with the community as this is a critical decision. 

### Co-op

Members may optionally purchase ownership of the platform as a one-off expense or subscription. These members will be able to vote on parts of the platform such as leadership and key decisions.


### Local democracy

Each local community (e.g. town, city) elects a committee to manage the region. The responsibilities may include running community events, moderating local issues and advertising locally for new hosts/members.

This model could be implemented at various scales, such as regional and country committees.


### Board structure

All members may vote for board members who direct the platform.
